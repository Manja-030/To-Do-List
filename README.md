# To-Do List App

This is a simple To Do list. The user can 
- add items to a list
- cross items out on the list by double clicking the text
- remove items by using the X button.

This was just a little project in my coding bootcamp to get familiar with jQuery. 
I had to convert the given JavaScript code into jQuery code.
